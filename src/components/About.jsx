                    In around 2020, after being shut inside due to COVID-19, I decided to pick up new hobbies to
                    keep myself occupied. Roblox, was a game I played and enjoyed in my free time, and decided to pursue
                    learning how to make my own games on the platform. I started learning Lua, the programming language used for Roblox development,
                    and began creating simple games. As I delved deeper into game development, I discovered a love for coding and problem-solving, and the
                    creativity that can be expressed with it.
                    This initial experience sparked my interest in programming, leading me to explore other languages and technologies over the years.
                    I found a way to program no matter what resources I had available, such as in Year 7-8, when all I had was a school Chromebook,
                    I picked up HTML, CSS and Javascript, as it was the only language I could use and see visually on it.

                But what else do I do?

                    Although I am very passionate about coding, I have a variety of other hobbies which I've
                    experimented with and still do on a regular basis. Something I love more than anything is expressing
                    myself through different art forms, which is why I've been drawing ever since a kid. I've much since advanced
                    past that, using my laptop to create digital art using Clip Studio Paint, and I have dedicated lots of my time
                    to improving and creating work that I'm proud of.

            <div className="w-full px-4 md:px-8 py-8 flex flex-col md:flex-row items-center gap-8" data-aos="fade-right">

                <p className='mt-10 text-lg text-center text-neutral-500 leading-relaxed'>
                    I also have quite an obsession for music, which mostly spiked
                    around 2023, when I discovered a few "underground" artists with a unique sound, which truly captivated me
                    and inspired me to start music production, using FL Studio. I started simple, using youtube tutorials to guide me, and when I
                    felt I had a good enough understanding of the software and music theory, I began experimenting on my own to make something unique
                    which I could be proud of - using synths and glitchy sounds and eventually finding my own sound.

                    But wait, it doesn't stop there! Following my love for game development,
                    came a love for 3D modelling, which I started learning using Blender. This advanced from simple game models to instead
                    scene-building, and eventually rendering my scenes out as art pieces, learning about a multitude of techniques, like
                    perfecting lighting, texturing and composition to create visually stunning images.

                    And finally, my last hobby (for now at least) is
                    video editing, which I began learning in 2022, using Adobe After Effects combined with a multitude of plugins to create
                    mesmerising edits of my favourite media, like animating manga scenes or editing experimental music videos. I love the creativity
                    and freedom that comes with video editing, and I deeply enjoy the process of bringing my ideas to life through this medium.
